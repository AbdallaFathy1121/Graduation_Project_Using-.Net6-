# Graduation Project (GOBA)

 Our website aims to provide several customized services to the user, whether the user is a patient or a doctor, as the
 site has several features and advantages.
 **There are four main servants**
1. **Diseases Detection:** Some serious lung diseases that are difficult to detect with the naked eye are detected, such as pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis and lung cancer. The doctor uploads the x-ray image to the site, and through artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is recognized if the patient has the disease, is healthy, or is exposed to the disease at a certain percentage
2. **Measuring box:** Through the measurement box, the heart rate, blood oxygen level, and temperature are measured through the finger of the hand, and these percentages are recorded on the site, and they are shown directly on its mobile application
